                            Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or

                    <strong>Global Scope:</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
                    known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be
                    accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Local Scope:</strong>If you were to define some variables inside curly brackets {} or inside
                    a specific function then those variables are called local variables The local variables have a very
                    confined scope which is called the local scope But, with the release of ES6, the local scope was
                    further broken down into two different scopes: 1.Function scope
                    2.Block scope.

                    How does Javascript event loop working?

                <div class="accordion-body">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
                    Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue
                    and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in
                    the Event Loop.
                    Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it
                    receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is
                    empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.

                    You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the
                    above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted
                    value to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.
